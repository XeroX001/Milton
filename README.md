# Milton
Milton is right now is just a basic discord bot who will tell you random joke on $joke command.



1. I used discord.py Python library here and coded this bot on Repl.it because Repl.it is online IDE that you can use in your web browser and here you can host your bot for free.

2. Packages used here are: py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py 

3. When you created your bot user on Discord, you copied a token.

4. Now click on Secrets(Environment Variables), we are going to create a Secret to store the token. If you are running your code locally, you don't need the Secret. Just replace os.environ['TOKEN'] with the token.

5. Secrets are used for declaring environment variables. On Repl.it, most files you create are visible to anyone but Secrets are only visible to you.  Other people viewing a public repl will not be able to see the contents of the Secret.
